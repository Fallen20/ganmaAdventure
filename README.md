## First 2D game done in Unity
Ganma and his sister, Wisp, live alone in the forest. After a brief discussion, Ganma is willing to prove to his sister he's capable to hunt.

## Notes
3 endings, once one is completed, a star will appear in the main menu. Probably something will happen if you collect all three...

- Will probably be an update once animations are fixed
